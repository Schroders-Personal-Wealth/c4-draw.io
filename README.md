## Loading the shapes library from XML

The `c4.drawio.library.xml` is a library definition that can be imported into an existing draw.io diagram and provides the C4 model shapes as a library.

To import the shapes library, first download your the XML and then in draw.io go to *File* -> *Open library from* -> *Device* and select the XML file from your device.

## Editing

Simply copy and paste shapes.

To edit shape data select a shape and press Cmd + M (on Mac).
